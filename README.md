Overview of Object Detection with YOLOv5
This repository provides a straightforward implementation for capturing images using a webcam and performing object detection using the YOLOv5 model. The workflow includes capturing a photo, processing the image, and applying the YOLOv5 model to detect objects in the image.

Features
Webcam Integration: Utilizes JavaScript for capturing images from the webcam, specifically designed to work seamlessly in Google Colab environments.
YOLOv5 Model: Leverages the pre-trained yolov5s model from the ultralytics/yolov5 repository, which is known for its accuracy and speed in object detection tasks.
Image Processing: Employs OpenCV for reading and converting the captured image to the format required by the YOLOv5 model.
Inference and Visualization: Performs inference on the captured image to detect objects and displays the detected objects directly on the image.
Workflow
Loading the YOLOv5 Model: The model is loaded from the ultralytics/yolov5 repository using torch.hub.
Capturing an Image: The script captures an image from the webcam and saves it locally.
Processing the Image: The captured image is read and converted to RGB format using OpenCV.
Object Detection: The YOLOv5 model performs inference on the image, detecting objects and displaying them.
Usage
Capture Photo: Execute the take_photo function to capture an image using the webcam.
Detect Objects: Use the detect_food function to apply the YOLOv5 model on the captured image and visualize the detected objects.
This implementation provides an accessible way to integrate webcam image capture and YOLOv5 object detection, making it suitable for various computer vision applications, including real-time detection and analysis.
